Since 1976, we have been guided by the belief that every individual holds the potential for positive change. We advocate, support, and most importantly, empower people to break barriers, find recovery, and reshape their destinies. Through the use of SPECIALIZED CASE MANAGEMENT&trade;, we create a world where recovery, justice and empathy lead to thriving communities. Our foundation is anchored at the intersection of behavioral health and the criminal legal system. Today TASC also operates at the forefront of transformative solutions. We are a social impact organization that embodies a future where health, safety and justice is synonymous with hope. We are TASC!</p>\n<p><b>Division Overview: </b>The Corrections Transition Programs (CTP) is a statewide network of clinical reentry management services with the overall purpose of increasing opportunities for successful reentry outcomes. CTP provides specialized case management services to help people prepare to return to their families and communities after incarceration. CTP works both inside prisons and in communities to provide reentry support, including, but not limited to, behavioral health referrals, public benefits enrollment, finding employment and housing resources and obtaining state IDs and vital records.</p>\n<p>We are currently looking for full-time &ndash; Network Housing Developer<br>\nStarting at $45,000 &ndash;$50,000 contingent upon experience, education, etc.</p>\n<p><b>Position Summary: </b><b>The Returning Home Illinois (RHI) Program</b> serves individuals returning from prison to Central and Southern Illinois who face significant and often compounded barriers to successful reentry, including serious mental illness, sex offense registry requirements, and arson-related convictions. Frequently excluded from traditional housing and support systems, these individuals are at increased risk of homelessness and recidivism. The program&rsquo;s primary goal is to provide <i>Permanent Supportive Housing</i> (PSH) for individuals traditionally considered hard to place, creating a foundation for long-term stability and successful reintegration into the community. Guided by low-barrier, housing placement principles, the RHI Program eliminates preconditions such as abstinence or mandatory treatment participation, offering immediate access to housing.</p>\n<p><b>The Network Housing Developer (NHD)</b> supports the PSH program by identifying and expanding safe, affordable housing opportunities for justice-impacted individuals. The NHD builds and maintains strong relationships with landlords, property managers, and housing providers to secure units and address barriers to housing access. Working closely with the PSH team, the NHD serves as a key liaison&mdash;communicating housing availability, lease updates, and any changes affecting client placement.
